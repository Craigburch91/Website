          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I started to teach myself coding just after Christmas 2019 starting with html and css, after becoming confident in those two language's I then moved onto Javascript.
             I have built a few projects for family and friends although most of my learning has been though Youtube (Traversy Media) Freecodecamp.org and Udemy.
          </p>

          <p>I am at the point in my life where i am looking for a career in web development hench why i chose to teach myself how to code 
             The reason behind my decision to teach myself coding is because I am abit of a gamer and it has always facinated me how it is done 
            so i did a little research on how they produce games and software after that i found it extrmeely interested and thought i would give it ago.
